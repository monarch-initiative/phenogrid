<div><h5>What is the score shown at the top of the grid?</h5><div>The score indicated at the top of each column, below the target label, is the overall similarity score between the query and target. Briefly, for each of the targets (columns) listed, the set of Q(1..n) phenotypes of the query are pairwise compared against all of the T(1..m) phenotypes in the target.<br /><br />Then, for each pairwise comparison of phenotypes (q x P1...n), the best comparison is retained for each q and summed for all p1..n. </div><br /><div>The raw score is then normalized against the maximal possible score, which is the query matching to itself. Therefore, range of scores displayed is 0..100.

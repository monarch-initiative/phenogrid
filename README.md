#About Phenogrid

Phenogrid is a Javascript component that visualizes semantic similarity calculations provided by OWLSim (www.owlsim.org), as provided through APIs from the Monarch Initiative (www.monarchinitiative.org).

Given an input list of phenotypes (you will see the sample input below) and parameters specified in config/phenogrid_config.js indicating desired source of matching models (humans, model organisms, etc.), the phenogrid will call the Monarch API to get OWLSim results and render them in your web browser in data visualization. And you may use the visualized data for your research.

#Installation Instructions

If you won't be doing any development of Phenogrid, you can simply download the phenogrid github zip file and unzip, then open the `index.html` to run this widget.

For developers who want to make changes to phenogrid, following is the process.

##1. Install npm

Before you get started, you will need to make sure you have npm installed first. npm is bundled and installed automatically with node.js. If you have not installed node.js, try:

```
curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup | bash -

yum install -y nodejs
```

For OS X machines, you can try these instructions: http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac. Or, just visit nodejs.org.

##2. Install phenogrid widget

To download and install the phenogrid widget, run

```
npm install
```

from this directory. Sometimes, it requires root access to for the installation, just run the following instead

```
sudo npm install
```

This will create a local `/node_modules` folder in the phenogrid root directory, and download/install all the dependencies(jquery, jquery-ui, d3, and jshashtable) and tools (gulp, browserify, etc.) into the local `/node_modules` folder.

##3. Run gulp to build bundled JS and CSS

```
gulp bundle
```

This command will use browserify to bundle up phenogrid core and its dependencies into `phenogrid-bundle.js` and create the merge `phenogrid-bundle.css` and put both files under `dist` folder.

##4. Add phenogrid in your target page

In the below sample code, you will see how to use phenogrid as a embeded widget in your HTML. Please note that in order to parse the js file correctly (since it uses D3.js and D3.js requires UTF-8 charset encoding), we suggest you to add the `<meta charset="UTF-8">` tag in your HTML head.

```html
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Monarch Phenotype Grid Widget</title>

<script src="config/phenogrid_config.js"></script>
<script src="dist/phenogrid-bundle.js"></script>

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="dist/phenogrid-bundle.css">

<script>
var phenotypes = [
	{id:"HP:0000726", observed:"positive"},
	{id:"HP:0000746", observed:"positive"},
	{id:"HP:0001300", observed:"positive"},

];

window.onload = function() {
    Phenogrid.createPhenogridForElement(document.getElementById('phenogrid_container'), {
        serverURL : "http://beta.monarchinitiative.org",
        phenotypeData: phenotypes,
        targetSpeciesName: "Mus musculus"
    });
}
</script>

<div id="phenogrid_container"></div>

```

#Configuration Parameters

##`serverURL`  string | required

This URL should be pointed to the OWLSim URL server associated with your installation containing the Monarch web services. You have three options:
- Use http://beta.monarchinitiative.org to connect to the development/test web services. This server is less stable than the production server.
- Use http://monarch.monarchinitiative.org to connect to the stable, production version of the web services (better uptime)
- If you are running the complete monarch-app, you can point it to http://localhost:8080, or whichever server/port you are using in your local installation.


##`phenotypeData`  array | required

It is a Javascript array of objects listing the phenotypes to be rendered in the widget.


##`targetSpecies`  string | optional

This parameter defaults to 10090 (mus musculus). Change this parameter if you want to compare the phenotypes in the phenotypeData parameter against a different species. Available Species:
- Name: Homo sapiens Taxon: 9606
- Name: Dani rerio Taxon: 7955
- Name: Drosophila melanogaster Taxon: 7227


# Testing and further configuration

Open the modified `index.html` or your target web page that has the phenogrid embeded in a web browser. This page will display an instance of the phenogrid, as configured above. Additional instructions for further customization of parameters will also be available on this page.

#Web Browser Support

Some phenogrid features are not support by IE 11 and below. So please use Google chrome, Fireffox, or Safari to open this widget.
